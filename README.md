# JavaScript Car Color Image Changer

A simple HTML project that demonstrates the power of JavaScript in changing HTML attribute values.

## Description

This project showcases how JavaScript can be used to dynamically change the `src` attribute of an `img` element, effectively changing the image displayed on the webpage. The project includes two buttons that, when clicked, change the image to a different color variant of a car.

## Features

- Demonstrates JavaScript's ability to change HTML attribute values.
- Includes two buttons that change the image to a different color variant.
- Uses the `document.getElementById` method to select the `img` element and change its `src` attribute.

## Code Highlights

- The `onclick` attribute is used to call a JavaScript function that changes the `src` attribute of the `img` element.
- The `document.getElementById` method is used to select the `img` element with the id `myImage`.
- The `src` attribute is changed to a different image file path when a button is clicked.

## Example Use Case

This project can be used as a starting point for more complex image galleries or sliders, where JavaScript is used to dynamically change the images displayed.

## Note

As mentioned in the code comment, it's not a good practice to apply the same JavaScript to many HTML elements directly. Instead, consider using a more robust approach, such as using a JavaScript library or framework, to manage and manipulate HTML elements.
